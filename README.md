\# Amazon Price Tracker (Demo)



This project demonstrates a simple price tracking system inspired by Amazon product monitoring.



\## Description

The Python script simulates product price changes and records them over time.

Each execution generates a new price value, saves the latest price in JSON format,

and appends historical prices to a CSV file.



\## Files

\- demo\_amazon\_price\_tracker.py — main Python script

\- output/latest\_price.json — latest price snapshot (generated locally)

\- output/price\_history.csv — price history log (generated locally)



\## How to run
